# About 

This is a Figma prototype based on a Course App for Sheridan students. The application will allow students to see and keep track of their course list and course assignments. Not only that but the prototype also has a proposed built in chat option which will allow students to communicate with their classmates or professors if they encounter any problem with their courses. The course also displays basic information such as user information and professor information to guide students.
