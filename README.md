# About 

This is a Figma prototype based on a Course App for Sheridan students. The application will allow students to see and keep track of their course list and course assignments. Not only that but the prototype also has a proposed built in chat option which will allow students to communicate with their classmates or professors if they encounter any problem with their courses. The course also displays basic information such as user information and professor information to guide students.

# Top five new desirable functionlities that I have not seen before in any other apps

1. Group Chat Options : None of the course applications I looked at had any live group chat options, in most of them you were only allowed to message one on one and weren't able to add other users into one chat

2. Smart Learning Assistant: A desirable functionality would be an  app that includes a smart learning assistant that can answer questions, provide feedback, and offer suggestions in real-time, something like Chat GPT but in a more controlled environment so students are also able to think for themselves with the help of the smart assistant. 

3. Social Learning Community: A desirable functionality would be an app that fosters a social learning community where students can interact with each other, share ideas, and collaborate on projects could provide an engaging and supportive learning experience. A lot of these apps seemed to dislike collaboration and focused more on isolating students by themselves. 

4. Multilingual Support: A desirable functionality would be an app that offers multilingual support for learners who speak different languages. This could provide a more inclusive and accessible learning experience to users who are not proficient in a certain language

5. Career Planning and Job Exploration: A desirable functionaly would be an app that offers career planning and exploration resources, such as career assessments, job market data, and networking opportunities
